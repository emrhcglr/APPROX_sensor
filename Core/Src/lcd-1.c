/*

The address of the PCF8574 is 0 1 0 0 A2 A1 A0 R/W. To change the address we are provided with A0, A1 and A2 pins.
By default these three pins are high so the address by default is 01001110 which is 0x4E.  
To change the address of this device, you have to connect any/all of these three pins to ground, which is provided just above them.

/*
    The above function will send the command to the device to which our LCD is connected.
    As we are using 4 bit LCD mode, we have to send command in two parts.
    First we send the upper nibble, and than the lower one. Both parts are sent along enable pin 1 and than with enable pin 0.
    When the data_t is OR(|) with 0x0C, which implies that P2 (En) pin is high and P0 (RS), P1(R/W) are low for the command and write operation.
    In the second case data is sent along with 0x08 only. This is to ensure that the back light is on and En, RS, R/W are all low.
